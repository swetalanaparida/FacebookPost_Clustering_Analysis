# FacebookPost_Clustering_Analysis
This project demonstrates the application of clustering algorithms to group Facebook posts from Thai fashion and cosmetics retail sellers. The analysis is based on various features like reactions, comments, shares, and status types. The goal is to evaluate the performance of different clustering methods and derive insights from the data.

# Objective
- Prepare and clean the dataset by handling missing values, detecting and addressing outliers, and performing descriptive statistics and visualization.
- Apply clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, and Agglomerative Clustering) on the dataset.
- Compare the clustering models using performance metrics like Silhouette Score, Calinski-Harabasz Index, and Davies-Bouldin Index.
- Provide insights based on the clustering results and evaluate the quality and distinctiveness of clusters.

# Technologies Used
- Python: Programming language used for the project.
- Libraries:
  - pandas: for data manipulation.
  - numpy: for numerical operations.
  - scikit-learn: for clustering algorithms (K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative Clustering) and performance metrics.
  - matplotlib & seaborn: for data visualization.
